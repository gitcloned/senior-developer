# Working on a GitHub Issue

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the /senior-developer skill."

## Overview

This skill reads the issue's current status from GitHub Projects and adapts its behaviour accordingly. It always confirms with the user before taking action.

```
User: "work on issue #123"
        │
        ▼
  Read issue + detect status
        │
        ├── Todo / In Analysis / No status → Analysis flow
        ├── In Progress                    → Development flow
        ├── In Review / Done               → Inform user, ask what to do
        └── Ambiguous                      → Ask user
```

**Things to keep updated on the issue (whenever relevant):**
- **Status** — move it forward as work progresses
- **Analysis comment** — post or update when analysis is done
- **Development plan comment** — post when dev approach is confirmed
- **Task Type** — set during analysis (Bug, Feature, Chore, etc.)
- **Size** — set during analysis (inferred from complexity)
- **Estimate** — set during analysis (numeric, inferred from size)
- **Iteration** — set when development starts
- **End date** — set when development starts

---

## Step 0 — Preflight checks

Before anything else, verify the required tools are available:

```bash
gh --version
```

**If `gh` is not installed:**
```
The GitHub CLI (gh) is required but not installed.

Install it:
  brew install gh          # macOS
  sudo apt install gh      # Ubuntu/Debian

Then authenticate:
  gh auth login
```
Stop and wait for the user to install.

**If `gh` is installed but not authenticated:**
```bash
gh auth status
```

If not logged in:
```
You're not logged in to GitHub. Run:
  gh auth login --scopes "read:org,repo,workflow,read:project,project"

Follow the browser prompt to authenticate.
```
Stop and wait for the user to authenticate.

**If `gh` is authenticated but missing `read:project` scope:**

Check the output of `gh auth status` for the Token scopes line. If `read:project` is not listed:
```
Your GitHub token is missing the "read:project" scope, which is needed
to read and update GitHub Projects status fields.

Re-authenticate with the required scope:
  gh auth login --scopes "read:org,repo,workflow,read:project,project"

This adds the scope on top of your existing ones.
```
Stop and wait for the user to re-authenticate.

**If `jq` is not installed:**
```
jq is required for reading GitHub Projects fields.

Install it:
  brew install jq          # macOS
  sudo apt install jq      # Ubuntu/Debian
```
Stop and wait for the user to install.

Once all checks pass, proceed.

## Step 1 — Identify the issue and confirm context

Extract owner, repo, and issue number from what the user provided:
- URL: `https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123`
- Number only: check current directory's git remote. If ambiguous, ask.

**Always confirm with the user:**

```
I'll be working on issue #<N> in <owner>/<repo>.
Branch to work from: <default-branch>
Does that look right?
```

Wait for confirmation. If the user corrects the repo or branch, use their values.

---

## Step 2 — Read the issue

```bash
gh issue view <N> --repo <owner/repo> --comments
```

Read: title, body, existing comments, labels, assignees.

---

## Step 3 — Detect status

Use the commands in `github-status-helper.md` to read the current GitHub Projects status.

If the issue is not on a project board, tell the user and ask how to proceed.

Route based on status:

| Status | Go to |
|--------|-------|
| `Todo`, `In Analysis`, or no status | **Analysis flow** (Step 4) |
| `In Progress` | **Development flow** (Step 5) |
| `In Review` | Inform user: "This issue is In Review." Ask what they want to do. |
| `Done` | Inform user: "This issue is marked Done." Ask what they want to do. |

---

## Step 4 — Analysis flow

### 4a. Check for existing analysis

Scan issue comments for one starting with `## Analysis`. If found, present it to the user:

```
There's an existing analysis on this issue:
<summary of existing analysis>

Want me to proceed with this, revise it, or start fresh?
```

Wait for user input.

### 4b. Gather inputs

If doing a fresh analysis, make sure you have:
- The full issue description and any linked issues
- The repo and branch to look at (confirmed in Step 1)
- Any context from existing comments

Launch an Explore subagent to understand the codebase around the affected area.

### 4c. Draft analysis and confirm

Present the analysis to the user **before posting**:

```
Here's my analysis — let me know if this looks right before I post it:

## Analysis

**What's the issue:**
<1-3 sentences. Plain description of what's broken or what's needed.>

**Approaches considered:**
1. <Approach A> — <tradeoff>
2. <Approach B> — <tradeoff>

**Recommended approach:** <which one and why, in one sentence>

**Risks / open questions:**
- <genuine unknowns, things that need human input>
```

Wait for user confirmation or edits.

### 4d. Post analysis comment

```bash
gh issue comment <N> --repo <owner/repo> --body "<confirmed analysis>"
```

### 4e. Update project fields

After posting the analysis, update the project item with inferred values. Fetch available options first (use `github-status-helper.md` sections 7–8), then set:

- **Task Type** — infer from the issue: Bug, Feature, Chore, or whichever option best fits. Pick the closest available option.
- **Size** — infer from complexity: XS / S / M / L / XL (or whatever options the project has). Base on scope of change.
- **Estimate** — infer a numeric estimate from size (e.g. S→1, M→3, L→5, XL→8). Use the project's configured scale if visible.

Show the user what you're about to set and confirm:

```
I'll update these project fields:
  Task Type → <value>
  Size      → <value>
  Estimate  → <value>

OK to apply?
```

Apply on confirmation using `github-status-helper.md` sections 7 and 8.

If a field isn't present on this project, skip it silently.

### 4f. Update status → In Analysis

Use `github-status-helper.md` commands to set status to `In Analysis` (if not already).

### 4g. STOP

```
Analysis posted to issue #<N>. Project fields updated. Status set to "In Analysis".
Review at: https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<N>

When you're ready to develop, say "develop" or "develop #<N>".
```

Do NOT write implementation code. Do NOT create a branch. Wait for the user.

---

## Step 5 — Development flow

### 5a. Assess current state

Check what exists:
- Is there a feature branch? (`git branch -a | grep issues/<N>`)
- Are there commits on it?
- Is there a development plan comment? (scan for `## Development Plan`)
- Is there an open PR?

Present your assessment:

```
Current state for issue #<N>:
- Analysis: <exists / missing>
- Branch: <exists with X commits / doesn't exist>
- Dev plan: <posted / not posted>
- PR: <open at URL / none>

<What I recommend doing next and why>

Want me to proceed?
```

Wait for confirmation.

---

### 5b. Create task list

Immediately after confirmation, call `TodoWrite` to create the development task list.

**Rules for building the list:**
- Include every task below.
- For each item that is already done (based on the assessment in 5a), set its status to `completed`.
- For items not yet started, set status to `pending`.
- Set the first not-yet-started item to `in_progress`.

**Task list items (in order):**

| id | content | Pre-complete if… |
|----|---------|-----------------|
| `dev-plan` | Post development plan to issue | Dev plan comment already exists |
| `branch` | Create feature branch and push | Branch already exists |
| `project-fields` | Set Iteration + End date on project | Both fields already set |
| `status-progress` | Set status → In Progress | Status is already In Progress |
| `start-comment` | Post start comment to issue | Start comment already posted |
| `write-tests` | Write failing tests (TDD) | Commits exist with test files |
| `implement` | Implement until tests pass | — |
| `run-tests` | Run full test suite — output must be shown | — |
| `commit-push` | Commit and push | — |
| `create-pr` | Create PR with `Closes #<N>` | PR already open |
| `completion-comment` | Post completion comment to issue | — |
| `status-review` | Set status → In Review | — |

> **Screenshot task:** If the issue involves UI changes, add an additional task `screenshot` — "Take screenshot of UI change" — between `commit-push` and `create-pr`.

**Hard rule — the test gate:**
> **Never move `commit-push` to `in_progress` until `run-tests` is marked `completed` AND the test output is visible in this conversation.** If asked to commit before showing test results, respond: "I need to run the test suite first — let me do that now."

---

### 5c. Post development plan (if `dev-plan` task is pending)

Mark `dev-plan` → `in_progress`.

Draft the plan and confirm with user before posting:

```
Here's the development plan — let me know before I post:

## Development Plan

**Changes:**
- <Component/class/model being added or modified> — <what and why>
- <API endpoint> — <what changes>
- <DB model> — <migration needed?>

**Task list:**
1. <concrete step>
2. <concrete step>
3. <concrete step>

**Acceptance criteria:**
- <what "done" looks like, from the issue or inferred>

**Key test cases:**
- <important scenario to test>
- <edge case worth covering>
```

```bash
gh issue comment <N> --repo <owner/repo> --body "<confirmed dev plan>"
```

Mark `dev-plan` → `completed`.

### 5d. Create branch (if `branch` task is pending)

Mark `branch` → `in_progress`.

```bash
git checkout -b issues/<N>-<short-description> <base-branch>
git push -u origin issues/<N>-<short-description>
```

Update the `branch_link` custom attribute on the issue:

```bash
gh project item-edit \
  --project-id <project-node-id> \
  --id <item-node-id> \
  --field-id <branch-link-field-id> \
  --text "issues/<N>-<short-description>"
```

Mark `branch` → `completed`.

### 5e. Set project fields (if `project-fields` task is pending)

Mark `project-fields` → `in_progress`.

List available iterations (section 10 of `github-status-helper.md`) and ask:

```
A couple of project fields to set:
  Iteration → <list available options, or suggest active one>
  End date  → <suggest iteration end date, or ask>

Confirm or adjust:
```

Apply using sections 9 and 10 of `github-status-helper.md`. Skip any field already set.

Mark `project-fields` → `completed`.

### 5f. Update status → In Progress (if `status-progress` task is pending)

Mark `status-progress` → `in_progress`.

Use `github-status-helper.md` to set status to `In Progress`.

Mark `status-progress` → `completed`.

### 5g. Post start comment (if `start-comment` task is pending)

Mark `start-comment` → `in_progress`.

```bash
gh issue comment <N> --repo <owner/repo> --body "Starting implementation on branch \`issues/<N>-<short-description>\`."
```

Mark `start-comment` → `completed`.

### 5h. Write failing tests

Mark `write-tests` → `in_progress`.

Write tests for the acceptance criteria defined in the development plan. Tests must fail before implementation begins — this confirms they actually test the new behaviour.

After tests are written and confirmed failing, mark `write-tests` → `completed`.

> **Milestone comments:** After each significant milestone during implementation (tests passing, key component done), post a brief comment:
> ```bash
> gh issue comment <N> --repo <owner/repo> --body "<milestone — one sentence>"
> ```

### 5i. Implement

Mark `implement` → `in_progress`.

Write implementation code until all tests from 5h pass. Follow the development plan.

When all tests pass, mark `implement` → `completed`.

### 5j. Run full test suite

Mark `run-tests` → `in_progress`.

Detect and run the full project test suite:

```bash
# Detect runner: check package.json "test" script, Makefile, pytest.ini,
# go.mod, Gemfile, etc. Use whichever matches the project.
# Examples: npm test / pytest / go test ./... / bundle exec rspec
```

Show the complete output in the conversation — do not summarise without showing raw output first.

**No test suite found:** Mark `run-tests` → `completed` with note "no test suite detected." Proceed to commit.

**Tests pass:** Capture the summary (pass count, test command used). Mark `run-tests` → `completed`.

**Tests fail:**
```
Tests are failing:
<relevant failure output — trimmed to key errors>

Fix failures or commit anyway? (fix / commit anyway)
```
- **Fix:** resolve failures, re-run, show output again. Only mark `run-tests` → `completed` once output confirms passing (or user explicitly accepts).
- **Commit anyway:** mark `run-tests` → `completed` with note "failing — user approved." Flag in completion comment.

> **Gate:** `commit-push` cannot move to `in_progress` until `run-tests` is `completed` and output is shown above.

### 5k. Commit and push

> **Before starting this task:** confirm `run-tests` is marked `completed` in the task list and its output is visible in this conversation. If not, go back to 5j.

Mark `commit-push` → `in_progress`.

Commit all changes and push to the feature branch.

Mark `commit-push` → `completed`.

### 5l. Take screenshot (if `screenshot` task exists)

Mark `screenshot` → `in_progress`.

```bash
screencapture -x /tmp/issue-<N>-screenshot.png

# Upload using gh CLI (no separate token needed)
gh issue comment <N> --repo <owner/repo> \
  --body "![screenshot](/tmp/issue-<N>-screenshot.png)"
# Note: gh handles auth via its own token. If direct upload isn't supported,
# attach the screenshot to the PR body instead.
```

Mark `screenshot` → `completed`.

### 5m. Create PR (if `create-pr` task is pending)

Mark `create-pr` → `in_progress`.

Create the PR. Include `Closes #<N>` in the body so GitHub auto-closes the issue on merge.

Mark `create-pr` → `completed`.

### 5n. Post completion comment

Mark `completion-comment` → `in_progress`.

```bash
gh issue comment <N> --repo <owner/repo> --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Implementation Complete

**PR:** <PR URL>

**What changed:**
- <bullet 1>
- <bullet 2>

**Tests:** <N> passed — `<test command used>`
<details>
<summary>Test output</summary>

```
<trimmed test output — last 30 lines or key summary>
```
</details>

**Screenshot:** ![preview](<screenshot-url>)
EOF
)"
```

- Omit `<details>` block if no test suite was found.
- Omit Screenshot line if no UI changes.
- If tests were failing at commit, replace Tests line with: `Tests failing — committed with user approval`.

Mark `completion-comment` → `completed`.

### 5o. Update status → In Review

Mark `status-review` → `in_progress`.

Use `github-status-helper.md` to set status to `In Review`.

Mark `status-review` → `completed`.

## Quick Reference

| Status | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Todo / In Analysis / None | Analyse → post analysis → update project fields → set In Analysis → STOP |
| In Progress | Assess → create task list → work through tasks → set In Review |
| In Review / Done | Inform user, ask what to do |

## Issue attributes to keep updated

| Attribute | When to update |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Status** | At each phase transition (In Analysis → In Progress → In Review) |
| **Analysis comment** | After analysis is confirmed by user |
| **Development plan comment** | Before starting implementation, confirmed by user |
| **Task Type** | End of analysis — infer from issue type |
| **Size** | End of analysis — infer from complexity |
| **Estimate** | End of analysis — infer from size |
| **Iteration** | When development starts — ask user |
| **End date** | When development starts — ask user or default to iteration end |

## Red Flags

- **Never** act without confirming with the user first
- **Never** post analysis or dev plan without user review
- **Never** skip asking about repo and branch when there's any ambiguity
- **Never** use labels to track workflow state — use GitHub Projects Status field
- **Never** push code without first posting the start comment
- **Never** claim "done" without a PR link in the completion comment
- **Never** write verbose AI-speak — keep comments concise and human-readable
- **Never** move `commit-push` task to in_progress without `run-tests` completed and output shown
- **Never** mark a task completed without actually performing the action

## Requirements

- `gh` CLI authenticated with required scopes: `gh auth login --scopes "read:org,repo,workflow,read:project,project"`
- Issue must be on a GitHub Projects board (for status tracking)
- `jq` installed (for parsing project field IDs)
